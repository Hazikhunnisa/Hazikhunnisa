        <h1>what is flask?</h1>
        <P>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be lightweight and flexible, providing the essential tools for building web applications without imposing a rigid structure or including many built-in features like a full-stack framework would.

        <h2>what is frontend?</h2>
        <p>Front End (Client-Side):
The front end is everything a user sees and interacts with directly in their web browser. <b><br> the visual and interactive part of a website.
Back End (Server-Side):</b>
The back end is the "behind-the-scenes" part of a website that users don't directly see. It handles data storage, processing, and the logic that makes the website function.</p>
         <h3>what is client and server ?</h3>
         <P>Client:
The client is the part of a web application that a user directly interacts with. It typically runs on the user's device (e.g., a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet) and is usually a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or a dedicated mobile application.</P>
